# Aider Setup and DeepSeek-Coder-V2 Integration

This script automates the setup of Aider configuration, including creating the necessary files, configuring the environment, downloading pre-trained models, and setting up a FastAPI server to serve a local LLM API.

## Aider Configuration

The script creates an Aider configuration file with the necessary API and model details. It sets the API to run on localhost and specifies the port using `$API_PORT`. The model is configured to reside in the `model/` directory within the cloned repository.

## Repository Cloning

The script checks whether the DeepSeek-Coder-V2 repository has been cloned into the specified `$REPO_DIR`. If it hasn’t, it clones the repository. If it already exists, it pulls the latest changes from the `main` branch to ensure the code is up-to-date.

## Virtual Environment Setup

The script creates a Python virtual environment using `venv` in the directory specified by `$VENV_DIR`. It then activates the virtual environment for the subsequent steps.

## Dependency Installation

The script installs dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file if it exists in the cloned repository. If the file is missing, it creates one with common libraries like `torch`, `transformers`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `requests`, and `vllm`. Afterward, the script uses `pip` to install all the listed dependencies.

## Pre-trained Model Download

The script downloads the pre-trained models from Hugging Face into a designated cache directory using `transformers`. It downloads both the tokenizer and the causal language model (DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B).

## API Server Setup

The script sets up a local FastAPI server to serve as the Local LLM API. It checks if the API server script (`local_llm_api.py`) exists in the repository. If not, it generates one that initializes the model, processes requests, and returns the generated completion results.

## Shell Configuration Update

The script modifies the user’s shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to include environment variables necessary for Aider to function, such as the API key, API base URL, and updating the `PATH` variable with the virtual environment's binary folder.

## Aider Installation

The script installs Aider via `pip`, ensuring the tool is available for use within the virtual environment.

## Aider Execution

The script generates a sample Python file (`sample.py`) containing a simple `add(a, b)` function and runs Aider on it, leveraging the configured local API and virtual environment.
